* dev ops is a method that allows for an effective way to deploy a product while minimizing costs accrued by things such as downtime 

* increasing effectiveness and efficiency
    - learn how the product works and how all the components come together to produce an output
    - cutting time between action and reaction
    - 

* the three ways
  - flow/systems thinking
	- emphasize the performance of the entire system and the focus on all value streams that are enabled by IT 
	- don't intentionally send defects down the stream 
  - amplify feedback loops
	- basically allow for open comms
	- feedback allows for corrections 
  - continual experimentation and learning 
	- take risks and learn from failures

* cams
  - culture
	- people first
  - automation
	- deployment is important so but tedious 
  - measurement
	- metrics ! 
  - sharing
	- feedback feedback
* ice
  - be an empath because the design of the system is dependent on it
