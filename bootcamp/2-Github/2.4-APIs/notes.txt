#graphQL
    * allows you to request only data that you need (easier queries)
    * rate-limits
        - API's limit the amount of requests that can be made depending on your github tier
        - with graphQL you can make a single request equivalent to 100 rest api calls 
            - because of this they calculate the cost using the number of nodes visited
